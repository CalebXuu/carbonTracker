    //case 1: if user choose a high carbon vehicle, Drive a low carbon vehicle;
    // case 2: if user drive too much car,Alternatives to driving. When possible, walk or ride your bike in order to avoid carbon emissions completely. Carpooling and public transportation drastically reduce CO2 emissions by spreading them out over many riders.
    // case 3: if user  drive a lot,Check out your transit options – It may not work for you every time, but use it when it does.
    // case 4: if user drive a long distance,  Studies have shown up to 30% of the difference in miles per gallon (MPG) is due to driving habits alone. You could save more than a ton of CO2 per year by:Anticipating your stops and starts,Maintaining a steady speed,Accelerating slowly and smoothly,Driving the speed limit
    // case 5 : if user drive a lot – Keep your tires properly inflated (just this can save 400-700 pounds of CO2 per year).
    // case 6:if user drive a lot, More Maintenance – Replace your air, oil and fuel filters according to schedule.
    // case 7: if user drive for a very short distance, Only a mile? – Walk.
    // case 8 : if user's electricBillCost is high,  LED lights contain no harmful materials and provide the same amount of light as a 60-watt incandescent, using up to 85 percent less power.
    // case 9: if user's electricBillCost is high, Programmable thermostat – Costs about $50 or less and will save you that much or more in the first year.
    // case 10: if user's electricBillCost is high, Enable your power management – so your computer and monitor shut down.
    // case 11:  if user's electricBillCost is high ,do like your Mom said- turn things off. If you’re going away or not using an item for awhile, unplug it to prevent “vampire” energy loss from electricity usage on standby.
    // case 12: if user's daily naturalGasConsumption is higher than 7.98 , your daily natural gas consumption is higher than the average of Canada
    // case 13: if user's monthly naturalGasConsumption is higher than 242, your monthly natural gas consumption is higher than the average of Canada
    // case 14: if user's monthly carbon emission higher than 1.125, your monthly carbon emission is higher than the average of Canada per capita
    // case 15:if user's yearly carbon emission higher than 13.5 tons, your yearly carbon emission is higher than the average of Canada per capita
    // case 16: if user's daily carbon emission higher than 0.03699 tons, your daily carbon emission is higher than the average of Canada per capita
    // case 17: if urser's yearly naturalGasConsumption is higher than 2915, your monthly natural gas consumption is higher than the average of Canada
    //case 18: the average of car driving distance is 18000Km per year, 1500km per month, 49 km per day
    // case 19: the average of electric consumption in cancada is 14930 per year, 1244 per month, 40 per day
    // case 20: take the bus, good move to protect our earth!
    // case 21 : walk,"Walk for earth, for your health! Good for you!"
    // case 22: take skytrain,
    // case 23: if user drives in the city way more then highway distance,
    //  case 24: month max goes good
